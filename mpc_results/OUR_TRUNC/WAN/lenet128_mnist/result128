Significant amount of unused triples of replicated Z2^64. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
Note that some protocols have larger minimum batch sizes.
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 68917.8 seconds 
Time1 = 68371.8 seconds (96723 MB, 5433606 rounds)
Data sent = 97071.9 MB in ~5478385 rounds (party 0 only; use '-v' for more details)
Global data sent = 291548 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of your code:
	program.use_edabit(True)
