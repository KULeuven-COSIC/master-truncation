The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 7.29587 seconds 
Data sent = 294.75 MB in ~16153 rounds (party 0 only; use '-v' for more details)
Global data sent = 865.661 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of your code:
	program.use_trunc_pr = True
