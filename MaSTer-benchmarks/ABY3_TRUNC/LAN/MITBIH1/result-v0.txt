Compiler: ./compile.py -R 64 MITBIH_inference1
	7749 triples of malicious replicated Z2^64 left
Significant amount of unused triples of malicious replicated Z2^64 distorting the benchmark. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
Spent 0.0795557 seconds (0.520592 MB, 312 rounds) on the online phase and 0.0419131 seconds (1.4153 MB, 40 rounds) on the preprocessing/offline phase.
Communication details (rounds in parallel threads counted double):
Broadcasting 0.001142 MB in 38 rounds, taking 0.00893229 seconds
Passing around 1.79477 MB in 114 rounds, taking 0.0198667 seconds
Receiving directly 0.881056 MB in 153 rounds, taking 0.046362 seconds
Sending directly 0.13884 MB in 47 rounds, taking 0.00262835 seconds
CPU time = 0.0787438
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 0.122707 seconds 
Data sent = 1.9359 MB in ~352 rounds (party 0 only)
Global data sent = 6.41706 MB (all parties)
Actual cost of program:
  Type int
         23667        Triples
          3708           Bits
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of your code:
	program.use_edabit(True)
Command line: ./malicious-rep-ring-party.x -v -p 0 -ip HOSTS MITBIH_inference1
