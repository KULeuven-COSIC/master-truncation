Significant amount of unused triples of replicated Z2^64. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
Note that some protocols have larger minimum batch sizes.
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 35294.6 seconds 
Time1 = 35180.4 seconds (96758.8 MB, 2393496 rounds)
Data sent = 96933.5 MB in ~2400308 rounds (party 0 only; use '-v' for more details)
Global data sent = 291117 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of your code:
	program.use_edabit(True)
