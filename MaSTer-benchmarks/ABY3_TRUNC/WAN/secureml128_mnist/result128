Significant amount of unused triples of replicated Z2^64. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
Note that some protocols have larger minimum batch sizes.
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 2864.56 seconds 
Time1 = 2716.04 seconds (6314.05 MB, 127336 rounds)
Data sent = 6495.94 MB in ~134420 rounds (party 0 only; use '-v' for more details)
Global data sent = 19618.8 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of your code:
	program.use_edabit(True)
