Using security parameter 40
Trying to run 64-bit computation
----------------------------------
Significant amount of unused triples of replicated Z2^64. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
Note that some protocols have larger minimum batch sizes.

The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 42676.9 seconds 
Data sent = 34059.9 MB in ~2220506 rounds (party 0 only; use '-v' for more details)
Global data sent = 102373 MB (all parties)
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of your code:
	program.use_edabit(True)
