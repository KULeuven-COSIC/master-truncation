Compiler: ./compile.py -R 64 MITBIH_inference1
	7749 triples of malicious replicated Z2^64 left
Significant amount of unused triples of malicious replicated Z2^64 distorting the benchmark. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
Spent 0.0832648 seconds (0.521792 MB, 419 rounds) on the online phase and 0.0453915 seconds (1.41602 MB, 100 rounds) on the preprocessing/offline phase.
Communication details (rounds in parallel threads counted double):
Broadcasting 0.001142 MB in 38 rounds, taking 0.00846883 seconds
Passing around 1.79477 MB in 114 rounds, taking 0.0182265 seconds
Receiving directly 0.884696 MB in 240 rounds, taking 0.0539627 seconds
Sending directly 0.14076 MB in 127 rounds, taking 0.00662671 seconds
CPU time = 0.0808077
The following benchmarks are including preprocessing (offline phase).
Time = 0.129691 seconds 
Data sent = 1.93782 MB in ~519 rounds (party 0 only)
Global data sent = 6.42282 MB (all parties)
Actual cost of program:
  Type int
         23667        Triples
          3708           Bits
This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of your code:
	program.use_edabit(True)
Command line: ./malicious-rep-ring-party.x -v -p 0 -ip HOSTS MITBIH_inference1
