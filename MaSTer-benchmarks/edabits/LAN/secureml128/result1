Significant amount of unused bits of replicated Z2^64. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.
Note that some protocols have larger minimum batch sizes.
Significant amount of unused edaBits of size 7. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size or increasing the bucket size with --bucket-size.
Significant amount of unused edaBits of size 20. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size or increasing the bucket size with --bucket-size.
Significant amount of unused edaBits of size 19. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size or increasing the bucket size with --bucket-size.
